Users API: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users

1. Using the jsonplaceholder api fetch a list of users to work with.
2. A message or loading indicator should be displayed when the app doesn't have users to display.
3. The app should display a vertical list of all the user's names from the api response.
4. Add a toggle feature to each of the user's name to show the user's address below the name when clicked. Also, assume the address section will need to be a shared component for future sections of the app.
5. It would be nice to search the list with a given user name and display a message if the search didn't find any matches.
6. Add some styles so that it's pretty :)
